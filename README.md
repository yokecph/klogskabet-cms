# Klogskabet CMS
Copyright Â©2018 YOKE ApS. All rights reserved.

## Description
CMS for Klogskabet installations at Danish public libraries.

### Overview
Klogskabet was commissioned by Ballerup Public Library. It's a set of physical installations that can be used by the library to present different themes to the library-going audience, i.e. a flexible exhibition platform. The exhibitions are primarily intended to highlight the breadth and depth of digitally accessible content that Danish libraries offer. This Rails app acts as a content management system for the digital/interactive parts of the installation.
